Assessment: Distinguishing Between Probability & Non-Probability Samples

Question 1
In each of the questions in this assessment, you'll read a description of a sample, and decide whether or not it is a probably or 
non-probability sample.
A random sample of U.S. households is selected from a population address list, and households in lower-income areas are randomly sampled at 
higher rate than households in higher income areas. Both sampling rates are known. The households are then mailed a paper survey asking
about employment status.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : a

Question 2
The telephone surveying technique known as random digit dialing (RDD) is used to select a random sample of households from two different lists: a list of randomly generated landline telephone numbers, and a list of randomly generated mobile phone numbers. Mobile phone numbers are sampled at a higher rate than landline numbers. Both rates are known.
a. Probability
b.Non-Probability
ANS : a

Question 3
A doctoral student in psychology wants to collect opinion information from the general campus population, but doesn’t have a large budget for her research. She decides to go out on one of the busiest campus street, wait on the corner, and ask people walking by if they would like to answer a few brief questions. She ultimately speaks with 100 people and analyzes the data.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : b

Question 4
A University survey research center selects a random sample of counties in the U.S. using probability proportionate to size, with a certain number of counties to be sampled from each of the four major regions of the United States. One hundred housing units are then selected at random within each randomly selected county, from all available housing units within each county, and one adult is selected at random within each household and invited to participate in a survey. 
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : a

Question 5
After randomly selected adults from the randomly sampled housing units in Question 4 above have completed a survey, they are invited to join a web panel that will receive invitations to complete web surveys throughout the year. 
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : a

Question 6
Visitors to a sports information web site click on an advertisement that says they can get paid for providing their opinions about current events.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : b

Question 7
A researcher visits a homeless shelter in a nearby city, tells some individuals currently residing in the center that they can receive compensation for participating in a survey, and indicates that they should also tell everyone in their social networks about this opportunity.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : b

Question 8
A psychology professor is told by a statistical consultant that she needs 100 males and 100 females to have enough statistical power to compare the two groups in terms of mean scores on a new scale that she is developing. She actively recruits student volunteers for the study, and turns away all interested volunteers after she hits her target of 100 people in each group.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : b

Question 9
Facebook wishes to estimate the proportion of Facebook users living in Washington, D.C. that has tweeted about Donald Trump in the past week. They select a random sample of 100,000 posts from all of these identified users in the past week, and analyze the content of the posts.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : a

Question 10
A large University wishes to collect information about incidents of sexual assault from its students. They obtain a list of all undergraduate students from the registrar’s office, and randomly select 2,500 males from all possible male undergraduates, and 2,500 females from all possible female undergraduates.
a. Probability
b. Non-Probability
ANS : a
