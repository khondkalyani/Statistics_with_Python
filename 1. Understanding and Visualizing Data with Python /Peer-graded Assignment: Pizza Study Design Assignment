Dear Smit,
CEO,
Pizza - Slice of Goodness.

Hey! I hope this memo finds you well. I have carefully considered your request to design a study that highlights the strength of 
'Pizza - Slice of Goodness' in comparison to the competitor  'The Pizza Factory'. After looking into various aspects I propose the study - 
Research Questions to be studied : As we know the strength of our company align with the two factors,  first one is the  taste and 
the other one is time required for delivery. So the research questions should include -
1. Rating the customers satisfaction regarding the taste of pizza.
2. Is the delivery time for 'Pizza - Slice of goodness' is significantly less than that of 'The Pizza Factory'? 

Variables to be studied: 
Delivery time which should be noted from confirmation of order till the delivery of pizza. Also the rating of satisfaction with the variables
scaling like very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied and fully satisfied.

Summarizing and Visualizing  Data:
Data of at least 100 customers should be collected. We can further plot box plot for time variables for both the companies also the pie diagrams
and frequency tables for the satisfaction rating of customers  for analyzing the data for both companies and drawing appropriate conclusions. 
Upon your approval, we will proceed with data collection following the necessary statistical analysis and present the findings in a 
report for your review.
Please reach out, if you have any further questions or adjustments to be made.

Thank you!
